Hello, I am Anthony Scholeno and I am pursuing an education and job in application development. I have 8 years of experience in the IT field as a network administrator. The following will be the starting point for my MSSA CAD project. With the ever-changing requirements for online education due to Covid-19 my goal is to create an application to improve online education.

 The first project that I researched was an online exam application. This would allow the “admin” to continuously update a bank of exam questions. The application would then generate a random exam from that bank for the student. As the student completes the exam it will return their grade immediately upon completion and recording it. This will help maintain the integrity of online education by ensuring each student does not have the same exam, so they are unable to share answers as easily.

The second project that I researched is an online course management system. This would allow the Teacher to keep all documents pertaining to the class in one centralized location. They would be able to upload any documentation pertaining to the class. This would create an easy way for students and teachers to remain in contact and ensure that they have all of the updated information that pertains to their class and are not falling behind.

The third project that I researched is a networking system. This would allow students and teachers to create logins and maintain groups in order to remain in contact even when they are unable to be in the classroom.  Students would also be able to message their teacher if they need any one on one help or extra guidance in general. This app would allow teachers and students to continue the education process without giving out any personal information such as phone numbers.

I know most teachers and students are in a new environment with online education and trying to find a way to get past the hurdles. My hope is with one of these projects I am able to improve the experience of both teacher and students experience with online education.
