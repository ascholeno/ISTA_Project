## Anthony Scholeno
## Project Part2

## Intro
My name is Anthony Scholeno and I hope to improve the online education system with a cloud based testing system. I hope to showcase what I have learned during the Microsoft Software Systems Academy in one complete project.
## Databases
The exam will be a multiple choice and be made up of different tables.
The first table that I will have will be a User table and it will consist of
  - UserID
  - Name


The Second table will be the Question table and will consist of
  - QuestionID
  - Question text

The Third table will be the Answers and will consist of
  - Answer options
  - text of the answer options
  - link to the questions

The Fourth table will consist of the User Answers and consist of
  - useranswerid
  - QuestionID
  - optionid


## Programming Phase
  - Continue researching
  - Create Database's
  - Integrate the Database's to work together
  - Design and develop webpage and GUI that will be used
  - Implement a way for administrators to update questions
  - Implement a way for results of exam to be accessible
  - Once a Alpha version is built have a user use the program and record all bugs that they encounter
  - continuously update and improve

## User interface
The interface I would like to present to the users is an online GUI. My goal is for them to be able to go to a website and login. After they login they will be able to select the exam that they are taking and answer the questions. Once the questions have been answered and the exam submitted it will
return their tabulated grade, so they immediately know how they did. My goal is to make the functionality of this like either the Microsoft online certification testing or the CompTia certification
exams.
## Brief Action plan

My plan of action to completing this project is to start by continuously researching the programming that needs to be completed to make this work. I know as more research that I do the more my design and expectations will change.
Next I will start by creating the questions/answers for the exam to have something to work off while creating the question database.  I will then create the databases that hold all the information that was
discussed earlier. Next, I will need to create the application that brings all the information together for a smooth user experience. And finally, I will create a html webpage that the app will
be accessed from.
